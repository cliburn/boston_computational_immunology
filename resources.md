# Resources for cytometry analysis in R

- [BioConductor packages for cytometry](https://master.bioconductor.org/help/search/index.html?q=cytometry/)
- [How to Use t-SNE Effectively](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/)

## Interesting new developments in visualizationm

- [Linear tSNE optimization for the Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10817)

> Using GPU acceleration and WebGL via TensorFlow.js to achieve real-time t-SNE dimension reduction in the browser.

- [Parallel t-SNE implementation with Python and Torch wrappers](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/Multicore-TSNE)

> Parallel version of t-SNE in Python. Fastest version of standard t-SNE.

- [Interpretable dimensionality reduction of single cell transcriptome data with deep generative models](https://bitbucket.org/jerry00/scvis-dev)

> Using deep learning to generate consistent t-SNE visualizations. Also preserves global structure  of clusters better.

- [Cytosplore](https://www.cytosplore.org)

> Hierarchical version of t-SNE as an interactive tool: "is an interactive visual analysis system for understanding how the immune system works".

- [Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap)

> A new algorithm that can generate t-SNE like plots but much faster. Derived from category theory foundations (?!).
